# Questions for the ACT Task Force:
1. Can the ACT Task Force please clarify definitions for the Test Subject Type? For example:
    - If a test rule is intended to evaluate appropriate programmatic designation of headings, would the test subject be "rendered page" or "DOM tree?"
2. How would the ACT Task Force recommend addressing use of specific testing tools to execute or facilitate execution of test rules?
