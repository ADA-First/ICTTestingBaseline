# 16. Links 

## Accessibility Requirements
* [WCAG2 2.4.4 Link Purpose (In Context)](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/navigation-mechanisms-refs.html) - The purpose of each link can be determined from the link text alone or from the link text together with its programmatically determined link context, except where the purpose of the link would be ambiguous to users in general.
* WCAG2 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value - For all user interface components (including but not limited to: form elements, links and components generated by scripts), the name and role can be programmatically determined.

## Test Rationale

## Limitations, Assumptions, Exceptions
* Links that are ambiguous to all users, where no additional context is available to assist in understanding the purpose of the link, are not included in this test. 

## Selector (Identify Content) for 2.4.4 and 4.1.2
1. Find all links, including those that are scripted elements and assigned a role of a link.

### Test Instructions for 2.4.4
1. Check that the purpose of each link can be determined from any combination of the link text, accessible name, accessible description, preceding page context.
#### Test Results for 2.4.4
* If any of the above checks fail, then SC 2.4.4 and this baseline fails.

### Test Instructions for 4.1.2
1. Check that the purpose of each link can be determined from any combination of accessible name and accessible description ONLY? (why would they duplicate the name test?)
#### Test Results for 4.1.2
* If any of the above checks fail, then SC 4.1.2 and this baseline fails.

## Advisory: Tips for streamlined test processes
* In cases where the link/control takes one to a document or a web application, the name of the document or web application would be sufficient to describe the purpose of the link (which is to take you to the document or web application). (U 2.4.4)
* <<KE: Just a note for our wg reference so I don't lose it. ANDI works well with them.>> Test pages for different link techniques include [ARIA link example](https://www.w3.org/TR/2016/WD-wai-aria-practices-1.1-20161214/examples/link/link.html) and [Link accessible name](http://not.webaccessibility.com/link-accessible-name.html).
