# 16. Links and User Controls
## Accessibility Requirements
* [WCAG SC 2.4.4 Link Purpose (In Context)](http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/navigation-mechanisms-refs.html) -- The purpose of each link can be determined from the link text alone or from the link text together with its programmatically determined link context, except where the purpose of the link would be ambiguous to users in general.
* [WCAG SC 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value](http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/ensure-compat-rsv.html) -- For all user interface components (including but not limited to: form elements, links and components generated by scripts), the name and role can be programmatically determined.

## Test Method Rationale
Links and/or user controls, including scripted elements, must have meaningful names that describe the unique destination, function, and/or purpose of the control for assistive technology.

## Test Procedure for SC 2.4.4 Link Purpose (In Context) and 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value
### Select/Identify Content
1. Find all links and user controls on the page, including those that are scripted elements.

### Test Instructions
1. Check that the purpose of each link/control can be determined from either
   1. the link/control text alone or 
   1. the link/control text together with its programmatically determined context (e.g., combination of accessible name, accessible description, table column/row association, enclosing list item, enclosing sentence, etc.).
1. If test 1 fails, check if any of these exceptions apply:
   1. the purpose of the link/control would be ambiguous to users in general.
   1. the purpose of the link/control is supposed to be unknown or obscured.

### Test Results
* If any of the above checks fail, then SC 2.4.4 fails and Baseline 16 fails


## Advisory: Tips for streamlined test processes
* In cases where the link/control takes one to a document or a web application, the name of the document or web application would be sufficient to describe the purpose of the link (which is to take you to the document or web application). (U 2.4.4)

### WCAG 2.0 Techniques
The following sufficient techniques and/or common failures were considered when developing this test procedure for this baseline requirement:
* [G91](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/G91.html): Providing link text that describes the purpose of a link
* [G53](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/G53.html): Identifying the purpose of a link using link text combined with the text of the enclosing sentence
* [ARIA7](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/ARIA7.html): Using aria-labelledby for link purpose
* [ARIA8](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/ARIA8.html): Using aria-label for link purpose
* [H77](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/H77.html): Identifying the purpose of a link using link text combined with its enclosing list item
* [H79](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/H79.html): Identifying the purpose of a link in a data table using the link text combined with its enclosing table cell and associated table header cells
