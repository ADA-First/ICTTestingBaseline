# 16. Links *removed, since this is in the SW part: and User Controls*
## Rationale
Links and/or user controls must have meaningful names that describe the unique destination, function, and/or purpose of the control for assistive technology.

Scripting Languages (e.g., JavaScript) can be used to attach a function to an element (image, link, etc.), and display information when triggered by an event (usually a mouse event - 'on mouse over', 'on mouse click', etc.). The scripted element must have a meaningful name.


### Test Rationale

### Test Method Rationale

## Accessibility Requirements
* WCAG2 2.4.4 Link Purpose (In Context) - The purpose of each link can be determined from the link text alone or from the link text together with its programmatically determined link context, except where the purpose of the link would be ambiguous to users in general.
* WCAG2 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value - For all user interface components (including but not limited to: form elements, links and components generated by scripts), the name and role can be programmatically determined.

## Tests for SC 2.4.4, 4.1.2
### Selector (Identify Content)
1. Find all links on the page.

### Test Instructions
1. Check that the purpose of each link can be determined from either
   1. the link text alone or 
   1. the link text together with its programmatically determined link context, except where the purpose of the link would be ambiguous to users in general.

##### Test Results for SC 2.4.4, 4.1.2
* If any of the above checks fail, then the content fails these SCs.

## Baseline Requirement Outcome
* If no content fails, then the content passes the Baseline Requirement
