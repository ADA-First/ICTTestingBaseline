# 6. Multi-state components
## Rationale
Components that can change their state must reveal their current state and function to Assistive Technology. States include such things as closed/open, sorted in ascending-order/descending-order, collapsed/expanded, and dynamic values that are shown on components (e.g., "34 characters remaining" **only if on the component itself, e.g. if shown in the text area, not outside? or (if outside) it should be the count that is evaluated?**, "Alert Priority 5"). *live regions?*

## Accessibility Requirements
* WCAG2 SC 1.1.1 Non-text Content: All non-text content that is presented to the user has a text alternative that serves the equivalent purpose, except for the situations listed below. Controls, Input: If non-text content is a control or accepts user input, then it has a name that describes its purpose.
* WCAG2 SC 1.3.1 Info and relationships: Information, structure, and relationships conveyed through presentation can be programmatically determined or are available in text. <<KE: I don't think this should be included since it deals with the presentation of text content for structure and relationships. I don't think it applies to a component that can change state.>>
* WCAG2 SC 1.3.3 Sensory Characteristics: Instructions provided for understanding and operating content do not rely solely on sensory characteristics of components such as shape, size, visual location, orientation, or sound. <<KE: I don't think this should be included since it deals with instructions and not the multistate component itself.>>
* WCAG2 SC 1.4.1 Use of Color: Color is not used as the only visual means of conveying information, indicating an action, prompting a response, or distinguishing a visual element.
* WCAG2 SC 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value: For all user interface components (including but not limited to: form elements, links and components generated by scripts), the name and role can be programmatically determined; states, properties, and values that can be set by the user can be programmatically set; and notification of changes to these items is available to user agents, including assistive technologies.

## Limitations, Assumptions, or Exceptions

## Test Procedure for SC 1.1.1, 1.3.1, 1.3.3, 1.4.1, 4.1.2 <<KE: remove 1.3.1 and 1.3.3>>

### Selector (Identify Content)
Identify components that indicate more than one status or can change their state. Examples include images, navigation trees, data table sort controls, etc. Note: It may be necessary to use the mouse to determine whether state changes occur on hover, or on click.

### Test Instructions
1. Determine the information that is conveyed visually (or by other sensory means) by the component about its current state.
1. Check that the accessible name, role and state, when considered together, provide this same information about its current state.
   1. If this test fails, and color is also the sole means of conveying state change, SC 1.4.1 fails in addition to all the other SCs listed.
1. Change the state of the component and repeat steps 1 and 2 for each possible state.
   1. Depending on the component, a change of state may be triggered by various actions, such as activation, toggling a function, entering data in the component, mouseover, etc.

* Note: If the number of possible states is too large or infinite, a sampling approach may be used.

#### Test Results
* If step 2 fails, these SCs fail: 1.1.1, 1.3.1, 1.3.3, 4.1.2 <<KE: remove 1.3.1 and 1.3.3>>
* If step 2 fails because color is the sole means of conveying state change, then 1.4.1 also fails

## Baseline Requirement Outcome
* If any SC fails, this baseline fails.
