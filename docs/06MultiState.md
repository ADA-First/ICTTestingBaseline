# 6. Multi-state components
## Rationale
Components that can change their state must reveal their current state and function to Assistive Technology. States include such things
as closed/open, sorted in ascending-order/descending-order, collapsed/expanded, and dynamic values that are shown on components (e.g., "34 characters remaining", "Alert Priority 5"). *live regions?*

## Accessibility Requirements
* WCAG2 SC 1.1.1 Non-text Content: All non-text content that is presented to the user has a text alternative that serves the equivalent purpose, except for the situations listed below. Controls, Input: If non-text content is a control or accepts user input, then it has a name that describes its purpose.
* WCAG2 SC 1.3.1 Info and relationships: Information, structure, and relationships conveyed through presentation can be programmatically determined or are available in text.
* WCAG2 SC 1.3.3 Sensory Characteristics: Instructions provided for understanding and operating content do not rely solely on sensory characteristics of components such as shape, size, visual location, orientation, or sound.
* WCAG2 SC 1.4.1 Use of Color: Color is not used as the only visual means of conveying information, indicating an action, prompting a response, or distinguishing a visual element.
* WCAG2 SC 3.2.1 On Focus: When any component receives focus, it does not initiate a change of context.
* WCAG2 SC 3.2.2 On Input: Changing the setting of any user interface component does not automatically cause a change of context unless the user has been advised of the behavior before using the component.
* WCAG2 SC 3.2.4 Consistent Identification: Components that have the same functionality within a set of Web pages are identified consistently.
* WCAG2 SC 4.1.1 Parsing - **doesn't belong here?** 
* WCAG2 SC 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value: For all user interface components (including but not limited to: form elements, links and components generated by scripts), the name and role can be programmatically determined; states, properties, and values that can be set by the user can be programmatically set; and notification of changes to these items is available to user agents, including assistive technologies.

## Limitations, Assumptions, or Exceptions

## Test Procedure for SC ...

### Selector (Identify Content)
Identify components that indicate status or can change their state. Examples include images, navigation trees, data table sort
controls, etc. Note: It may be necessary to use the mouse to determine whether state changes occur on hover, or on click. 

### Test Instructions
1. Determine the information that is conveyed visually by the component about its current state.
1. Check that the accessible name, role and state, when considered together, provide this same information about its current state.
1. Change the state of the component and repeat steps 1 and 2 for each possible state.
   1. Depending on the component, a change of state may be triggered by various actions, such as activation, toggling a function, entering data in the current component, entering data in or activating a related component (e.g. character count), mouseover, etc.

* Note: If the number of possible states is too large or infinite, a sampling approach may be used.

#### Test Results
* If step 2 fails, this SC fails

## Baseline Requirement Outcome
* If any SC fails, this baseline fails.
