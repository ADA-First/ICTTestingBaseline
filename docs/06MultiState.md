# 6. Dynamic Content
## Rationale
### Requirement Rationale
Visual presentation of content changes generally make such changes evident to sighted users, but they can be difficult to impossible to discern for screen-reader users. Content changes could include component state changes (e.g.,   closed/open sections, sort order, collapsed/expanded menus), dynamic and/or calculated values (e.g., "34 characters remaining"), and automatically updating stock prices (e.g., via live regions). Content that changes in the course of a user's interaction with the content (including, but not limited to changes in text, component states, structure, relationships, or functionality) must provide a means by which the change in content is programmatically determinable or is otherwise available in text.

### Test Method Rationale
To identify visual changes to information and compoenent states and correlation with equivalent programmatic and/or textual information requires manual inspection of changes to content and related programmatic attributes.

## Accessibility Requirements
* WCAG2 SC 1.1.1 Non-text Content: All non-text content that is presented to the user has a text alternative that serves the equivalent purpose, except for the situations listed below. Controls, Input: If non-text content is a control or accepts user input, then it has a name that describes its purpose.
* WCAG2 SC 1.3.1 Info and relationships: Information, structure, and relationships conveyed through presentation can be programmatically determined or are available in text. <<KE: I don't think this should be included since it deals with the presentation of text content for structure and relationships. I don't think it applies to a component that can change state.>>
* WCAG2 SC 1.3.3 Sensory Characteristics: Instructions provided for understanding and operating content do not rely solely on sensory characteristics of components such as shape, size, visual location, orientation, or sound. <<KE: I don't think this should be included since it deals with instructions and not the multistate component itself.>>
* WCAG2 SC 1.4.1 Use of Color: Color is not used as the only visual means of conveying information, indicating an action, prompting a response, or distinguishing a visual element.
* WCAG2 SC 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value: For all user interface components (including but not limited to: form elements, links and components generated by scripts), the name and role can be programmatically determined; states, properties, and values that can be set by the user can be programmatically set; and notification of changes to these items is available to user agents, including assistive technologies.

## Limitations, Assumptions, or Exceptions

## Test Procedure for SC 1.1.1, 1.3.1, 1.4.1, 4.1.2

### Select/Identify Content
Identify components that indicate more than one status or can change their state. Examples include images, navigation trees, data table sort controls, etc. Note: It may be necessary to use the mouse to determine whether state changes occur on hover, or on click.

### Test Instructions
1. Determine the information that is conveyed visually by the component about its current state.
1. Check that the accessible name, role and state, when considered together, provide this same information about its current state.
   1. If information about the current state of component is not available programmatically, check that equivalent text is provided that conveys the same information.
   1. If this test fails, and color is also the sole means of conveying state change, SC 1.4.1 fails in addition to all the other SCs listed.
1. Change the state of the component and repeat steps 1 and 2 for each possible state.
   1. Depending on the component, a change of state may be triggered by various actions, such as activation, toggling a function, entering data in the component, mouseover, etc.

* Note: If the number of possible states is too large or infinite, a sampling approach may be used.

### Test Results
* If step 2 fails, these SCs fail: 1.1.1, 1.3.1, 1.3.3, 4.1.2 <<KE: remove 1.3.1 and 1.3.3>>
* If step 2 fails because color is the sole means of conveying state change, then 1.4.1 also fails

## Baseline Requirement Outcome
* If any SC fails, this baseline fails.
