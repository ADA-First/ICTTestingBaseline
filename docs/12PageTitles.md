# 12. Page Titles
## Rationale
### Requirement Rationale
A Web page must have a programmatic title that identifies the Web page and makes sense without requiring users to read or interpret page content. 

### Test Method Rationale
<<Include language to describe why we are testing the way we have outlined>>

## Accessibility Requirements
* WCAG2 SC 2.4.2 Page Titled -- Web pages have titles that describe topic or purpose.

## Limitations, Assumptions, Exceptions
* Assumption: every page should have a descriptive title; if a page title does not exist for a page, the page would fail for this Baseline Requirement and the page would not be conformant with SC 2.4.2.

## Test Procedure 
### Select/Identify Content
Identify the title for the page.

### Test Instructions
1. Review the page content and the Page Title.
1. Check if the Page Title identifies the contents or purpose of the Web page.
1. Check if the Page Title can be used to distinguish pages within a site.

### Test Results
* If any of the above checks fail, then this SC fails, and the Baseline Requirement fails.

## Advisory Tips for a Streamlined Test Process
The following techniques and/or common failures were considered when developing the test procedure for this baseline requirement:
  * Technique G88: Providing descriptive titles for Web page
  * Technique H25: Providing a title using the title element
  * F25: Failure of Success Criterion 2.4.2 due to the title of a Web page not identifying the contents
