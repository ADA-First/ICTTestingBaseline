# 6. Changing Content

## Accessibility Requirements
* WCAG2 SC 1.3.1 Info and relationships: Information, structure, and relationships conveyed through presentation can be programmatically determined or are available in text.
* WCAG2 SC 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value: For all user interface components (including but not limited to: form elements, links and components generated by scripts), the name and role can be programmatically determined; states, properties, and values that can be set by the user can be programmatically set; and notification of changes to these items is available to user agents, including assistive technologies.
*<<KE comment: for simplicity, I would only keep 4.1.2 (and maybe 1.3.1) since 4.1.2 covers just about everything.>>*

### Test Method Rationale
To identify visual changes to content and component states that occur without a page refresh and to correlate those changes with equivalent programmatic and/or textual information. Content changes could include component state changes (e.g., closed/open sections, sort order, collapsed/expanded menus), dynamic and/or calculated values (e.g., "34 characters remaining"), and automatically updating stock prices. Content that changes in the course of a user's interaction with the content (including, but not limited to changes in text, component states, structure, relationships, or functionality) must provide a means by which the change in content is programmatically determinable or is otherwise available in text.

## Limitations, Assumptions, or Exceptions


## Test Procedure for SC 1.1.1, 1.3.1, 4.1.2
### Select/Identify Content
Identify changes in presented content. Examples include changes to images, navigation trees, data table sort controls, automatic information updates, etc. 
* It may be necessary to use the mouse to determine whether state changes occur on hover, or on click.
* Depending on the component, a change of state may be triggered by various actions, such as changing values or states of other components, toggling a function, entering data in the component, mouseover, etc.

### Test Instructions
1. Check that the page provides information programmatically about the changes in presented content.
    * For changes to content [accessible name and description](https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aam-1.0/#accessible-name-and-description-computation) (e.g., name, role, state, title, value) when considered together, should provide the information about the change programmatically.
    * If information about the current state of component is not available programmatically, check that equivalent text is provided that conveys the same information.
1. Check that the page provides equivalent programmatic notification of changes (e.g., appropriate use of ARIA live regions).
1. Repeat steps 1 and 2 for observed content changes, including each possible state for multi-state components.

* **Note**: If the number of possible states is too large, a sampling approach may be used.

### Test Results
* If check #1 or #2 fails, then SCs 1.3.1 and 4.1.2 fail.

**Note:** If color is the sole means of presenting changes visually, [Baseline 8. Color (meaning)](08ColorMeaning.md)) would fail (SC 1.4.1).

## Baseline Requirement Outcome
If any SC fails, this baseline fails.

## Advisory Tip:
* Changing content might also include changes in color to convey information; if color is used as the only visual means of conveying information (or changes in information), then the content would fail to meet SC 1.4.1 Use of Color (addressed in [Baseline 8. Color (meaning)](08ColorMeaning.md))
