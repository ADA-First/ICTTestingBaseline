# 6. Changing Content

## Accessibility Requirements
* [WCAG2 SC 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/ensure-compat-rsv.html): For all user interface components (including but not limited to: form elements, links and components generated by scripts), the name and role can be programmatically determined; states, properties, and values that can be set by the user can be programmatically set; and notification of changes to these items is available to user agents, including assistive technologies.

### Test Method Rationale
To identify visual changes to content and component states that occur without a page refresh and to correlate those changes with equivalent programmatic and/or textual information. Content changes could include component state changes (e.g., closed/open sections, sort order, collapsed/expanded menus), dynamic and/or calculated values (e.g., "34 characters remaining"), and automatically updating stock prices. Content that changes in the course of a user's interaction with the content (including, but not limited to changes in text, component states, structure, relationships, or functionality) must provide a means by which the change in content is programmatically determinable or is otherwise available in text.

## Limitations, Assumptions, or Exceptions
* Other WCAG SC's could have been included (1.1.1 Non-text Content, 1.3.1 Info and relationships, for example) but since accessibility properties checked under 4.1.2 would be adequate, 4.1.2 is the only SC in this test.
* The state of form elements (checked, unchecked, etc.) are included in this test.

## Test Procedure for SC 4.1.2
### Select/Identify Content
Identify changes in presented content. Examples include changes to images, navigation trees, data table sort controls, automatic information updates, form elements, revealed content, etc. 
* It may be necessary to use the mouse to determine whether state changes occur on hover, or on click.
* Depending on the component, a change of state may be triggered by various actions, such as changing values or states of other components, toggling a function, entering data in the component, mouseover, etc.

### Test Instructions
1. For each available change in content, check that the Name, role, state, value (when considered together) of the changed content are accurate and provide adequate information about the change programmatically.
   * Name: the name [accessible name and description](https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aam-1.0/#accessible-name-and-description-computation) is accurate after a change, if applicable.
   * Role: the role accurately describes the purpose of the element after a change, if applicable.
   * State: the state of the element is accurate after a change, if applicable.
   * Value: the value is updated after a change, if applicable.
1. Check that the page provides equivalent programmatic notification of changes (e.g., appropriate use of ARIA live regions). *<<KE comment is this always required for every content change? if not when is it required? >>*

### Test Results
* If any of the above checks fails, then this SC and the baseline fail.

## Advisory Tip:
* Changing content might also include changes in color to convey information; if color is used as the only visual means of conveying information (or changes in information), then the content would fail to meet SC 1.4.1 Use of Color (addressed in [Baseline 8. Color (meaning)](08ColorMeaning.md))
* If the number of possible states is too large, a sampling approach may be used.
