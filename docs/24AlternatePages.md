# 24. Alternate Pages

## Rationale
An Alternate Page should only be provided for accessibility when the primary page cannot be made accessible. The accessible version must contain the same information as the primary page.

The information should be 'equivalent', but by definition this is not going to be 'exactly the same'. The main points, themes, concepts etc. that the authors are trying to get across in the primary content should also come across in the alternate page.

## Accessibility Requirements
* WCAG2 Conformance requirement #1: Conforming alternate version

## Limitations, Assumptions, or Exceptions

## Test Procedure for SC 

### Selector (Identify Content)
1. Any alternate pages/sites for content (pay particular attention to content containing maps, directions, complex charts etc.).

### Test Instructions
1. Check that the content of the primary page/site and the alternate page/site are equivalent.
1. Check that the alternate page/site passes the other baseline tests.

#### Test Results
* If either test fails, this SC fails.

## Baseline Requirement Outcome
* If this SC fails, this baseline fails.
