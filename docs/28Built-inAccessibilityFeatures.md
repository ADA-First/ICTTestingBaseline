# 28 Built-in Accessibility Features
## Rationale
Assistive technology (AT) is provided to users with disabilities with the intent of providing them equivalent access to information. These tools are designed with a specific disability or disabilities in mind. As such they target specific audiences and are not intended for general use by all users.
### Test Method Rationale
Software is required to interoperate with assistive technology unless the ICT is self-contained and accessible, requiring no AT or other equipment (other than an headset or other audio coupler) for operation.
## Accessibility Requirements
**Appendix C to Part 1194 – Functional Performance Criteria and Technical Requirements: 402 Closed Functionality:** 
* 402.1 ICT with closed functionality shall be operable without requiring the user to attach or install assistive technology other than personal headsets or other audio couplers, and shall conform to 402.
* https://www.access-board.gov/guidelines-and-standards/communications-and-it/about-the-ict-refresh/final-rule/text-of-the-standards-and-guidelines#502-interoperability-assistive-technology

**Appendix B to Part 1194 – Section 255 of the Communications Act:502 Interoperability with Assistive Technology:**
* 502.1 Software shall interoperate with assistive technology and shall: 
conform to 502.

## Limitations, Assumptions, or Exceptions
Software that is assistive technology and supports the accessibility services of a platform is **NOT required** to conform to: 
* E207.2 requirements for platforms and applications to conform to Level A and Level AA Success Criteria.
* ICT with closed functionality shall be operable without requiring the user to attach or install assistive technology other than personal headsets or other audio couplers, and shall conform to 402.
