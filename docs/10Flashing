# 10. Flashing

## Requirement Rationale
The intent of this Success Criterion is to allow users to access the full content of a site without inducing seizures due to photosensitivity. 

## Test Method Rationale
Flashing can be caused by the display, the computer rendering the image or by the content being rendered. As the author has no control of the first two, this test addresses the content itself. Furthermore, as there is no reliable, freely or widely available solution for determining the resulting flicker frequency, this test focuses on 
* determining the flicker rate from programmatically available information, and 
* determining if any flashing element is within the "small safe area" per *ST G176 - Keeping the flashing area small enough*.

## Accessibility Requirements
* WCAG2: 2.3.1 Three Flashes or Below Threshold

## Tools Necessary
* Visual inspection and use of PITS (Pie in the Sky) Flash Area favelet
    
## Limitations, Assumptions, or Exceptions
* Limitations:  This test does not consider the 
* Exceptions: 
    * media that is a media alternative for text and is clearly labeled as such (1.2.3)

#### Accessibility Support
* Requires an accessible video player

#### Test Subject Types 
Rendered video

## Test Procedure
### Selector (Identify Content)
1. Find interface components that play video or other synchronized media content when activated.
2. Determine if the media is clearly labeled as a media alternative for text. If it is, do not apply this test.
3. Play the content. Determine video segments where audio descriptions of relevant information are needed.

### Test Instructions

#### Tests for SC 1.2.5
1. For each video segment that requires audio description, check that
   1. there is audio description provided. This may be on a user-selectable, audio track that includes audio descriptions, per *G78: providing a second, user-selectable, audio track that includes audio descriptions*
   1. the audio description is time-synchronized with the video
   1. the audio description provides sufficient information about actions, characters, scene changes, and on-screen text that are important and are not described or spoken in the main sound track
1. If any of the above fails, check if there is an alternate version provided, per *G8: Providing a movie with extended audio descriptions*
   1. Check that the alternate version meets the criteria listed in Step 1.
   1. Check that 
      1. users are clearly informed about this alternate option using a conformant technique
      1. it can be easily accessed in a conformant manner
      1. a clearly labelled, conformant means is provided to easily return to the primary event flow

##### Test Results SC 1.2.5
* If both tests for SC 1.2.3 fail, then the content is not conformant to SC 1.2.5

## Baseline Requirement Outcome
* If no content fails, then the content passes the Baseline Requirement
