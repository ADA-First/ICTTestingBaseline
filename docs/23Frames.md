# 23. Frames
## Accessibility Requirements
* [WCAG SC 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value](http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/ensure-compat-rsv.html) -- For all user interface components (including but not limited to: form elements, links and components generated by scripts), the name and role can be programmatically determined; states, properties, and values that can be set by the user can be programmatically set; and notification of changes to these items is available to user agents, including assistive technologies.

### Test Method Rationale
While sighted users can recognize the structure presented by frames and iframes, non-sighted user rely on programmatic elements to determine their content. This test method determines the adequacy of the code to describe the contents of any `<frame>` or `<iframe>` for Assistive Technology.

In HTML5 the `<frame>` element is marked as obsolete. The `<iframe>` element remains part of the HTML5 specification. While the `<frame>`element has been deprecated in HTML5, testers may still encounter web pages and/or web applications with code that while outdated, can and should still be accessible.

## Test Procedure for SC 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value
### Select/Identify Content
Find all Frames and iFrames in the page

### Test Instructions
1. Check that each `<frame>` has a `title` attribute that describes its content 
1. Check that the combination of [accessible name and description](https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aam-1.0/#iframe-element) for each `<iframe>` describes its content

### Test Results
* If any of the above checks fail, then the content fails this SC, and this baseline fails.

## Advisory: Tips for a Streamlined Test Process

### WCAG 2.0 Techniques
* The following technique and/or common failures were considered when developing this test procedure for this baseline requirement:
    * [H70: Using frame elements to group blocks of repeated material](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/H70.html)
    * [H64: Using the title attribute of the frame and iframe elements](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/H64.html)
