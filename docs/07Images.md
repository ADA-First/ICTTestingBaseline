# 7. Images

## Accessibility Requirements
* [WCAG2 SC: 1.1.1. Non-Text](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/text-equiv-all.html) -- All non-text content that is presented to the user has a text alternative that serves the equivalent purpose, except for [specific] situations listed. 
* [WCAG2 SC: 1.4.5 Images of Text](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-text-presentation.html) -- If the technologies being used can achieve the visual presentation, text is used to convey information rather than images of text except for [specific situation listed].
* [WCAG2 SC: 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/ensure-compat-rsv.html) -- For all user interface components (including but not limited to: form elements, links and components generated by scripts), the name and role can be programmatically determined; states, properties, and values that can be set by the user can be programmatically set; and notification of changes to these items is available to user agents, including assistive technologies. 

## Test Method Rationale
All meaningful and decorative images must be evaluated. Tests for certain image types are specified. 

## Limitations, Assumptions, Exceptions
  * Image formats include .jpg, .png, .svg, .gif, .tiff, .bmp.
  * Decoration, Formatting, Invisible: If image is pure decoration, is used only for visual formatting, or is not presented to users, then it is implemented in a way that it can be ignored by assistive technology.
 * CAPTCHA: If the purpose of the image is to confirm that content is being accessed by a person rather than a computer, then text alternatives that identify and describe the purpose of the image(s) are provided, and alternative forms of CAPTCHA using output modes for different types of sensory perception are provided to accommodate different disabilities.   
 * Images of text which are essential to the information being conveyed are exempt from SC 1.4.5. Logotypes (text that is part of a logo or brand name) are considered essential.
 * Equivalent descriptions for an image within page text would render an image decorative.
 * While a `longdesc` attribute has been used historically to provide extended description for images and is listed as a sufficent technique in WCAG ([H45](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/H45.html)), the technique [is not well supported for accessibility](https://webaim.org/techniques/alttext/longdesctestcases.htm); therefore, this Baseline does not accept the technique.
 
## Test Procedures for SC 1.1.1 Non-Text and 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value
### Select/Identify Content
1. Identify all images
1. Review the context of the image to determine the purpose of the image:
  * **Meaningful:** conveys information (include images of text; functional images used to initiate action, convey meaning, or prompting a response; image maps, etc.)
  * **Decorative:** conveys no meaningful information or is described in text content 
  * **Icon Fonts:** decorative font rendered as an image
  * **Text:** image of text, except where the text is part of a logo
  * **CAPTCHA:** designed to determine if content is being accessed by a person rather than a computer

### Meaningful Images
#### Test Instructions
If the image is meaningful:
1. Check that the combination of accessible name and accessible description provide an equivalent description. Numerous attributes contribute to the computation of the accessible name and accessible description.
   [HTML Accessibility API Mappings 1.0 for img](https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aam-1.0/#img-element)
1. Check that the role is NOT "presentation".
1. Check that aria-hidden is NOT set to true.

#### Test Results
* If check 1 fails, then SC 1.1.1 and Baseline Requirement 7 fail.
* If check 2 or 3 fails, then SC 4.1.2 and Baseline Requirement 7 fail.

### Decorative Images
#### Test Instructions
If the image is decorative, check that at least one of the following is true:
1. The ARIA role is "presentation".
1. The aria-hidden state is set to "true".
1. The combination of accessible name and accessible description is an empty string (i.e., "").
    * Numerous attributes contribute to the computation of the accessible name and accessible description. 
    * [HTML Accessibility API Mappings 1.0 for img](https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aam-1.0/#img-element)

#### Test Results
* If all of the above checks fail, then SC 1.1.1 and Baseline Requirement 7 fail.

### Icon Fonts
#### Test Instructions
If the image is an icon font, check that one of the following is true: 
1. Check that the icon provides an accurate text equivalent, e.g., via a `title=` attribute (with FontAwesome) or via inner text of the inline element (for Google icons).
2. Check that the icon semantic information does not duplicate, confuse, or contradict the text alternative evaluated in the check above.
    * Note: different icon fonts may use different techniquest to "hide" icon semantic information; for example:
        * FontAwesome directs developers to set `aria-hidden` to "true" while providing a descriptive `title` attribute for the icon element
        * Google Icons uses CSS styling to replace the inner text of an inline element with an icon image when rendered in the browser; therefore, there is no need to hide the icon, and the inner text would generally serve to provide the text equivalent. If, however, the inner text of the Google Icon is not sufficiently descriptive, then the developer would still need to provide an accurate text equivalent via an alternative technique.

#### Test Results
* If any of the above checks fail, then SC 1.1.1 and Baseline Requirement 7 fail.

### Captcha Images
#### Test Instructions
If the Image is a Captcha image:
1. Check that the combination of accessible name and accessible description identify and describe the purpose of the CAPTCHA.
1. Check that alternative forms of CAPTCHA are provided, at a minimum, for users without vision and users without hearing.

#### Test Results
* If any of the above checks fail, then SC 1.1.1 and Baseline Requirement 7 fail.

## Test Procedures for SC 1.4.5 Images of Text
### Select/Identify Content
Identify any images of text, except where a particular presentation of text  is essential to the information being conveyed (e.g., logotypes or text that is part of a logo or brand name).

### Test Instructions 
1. Check that the technologies being used CANNOT achieve the visual presentation using text to convey information rather than images of text.
1. Check that the image of text can be visually customized to a user's requirements.
   * For example, a Web site allows users to specify font settings and all images of text on the site are then provided based on those settings.

### Test Results
* If any of the above checks fail, then SC 1.4.5 and Baseline Requirement 7 fail.

## Advisory: Tips for streamlined test processes
* An example of an accessible CAPTCHA is [recaptcha](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/demo?invisible=true)
