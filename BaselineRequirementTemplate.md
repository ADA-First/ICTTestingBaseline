##### Test Cases

##### Output
Each element tested will return a test result of pass or fail for eash test case as well as a description of any errors causing a failure result. 
/[Test case results are combined with other test case results to provide a cumulative outcome, pass or fail, of the rule. When a rule has multiple test cases, the results of all test cases are combined to give a single result for each selected item. The results are cumulative, meaning that as long as one test case passes, the rule has passed./]
/[If either one of these passed, the rule has passed. Only if both fail, does that element fail the rule./]
* Passed - if any test case passed
* Failed - if no test case passed

## Baseline Test Outcome
Pass: All outputs of Baseline Requirement test rules passed

Fail: Any output of Baseline Requirement test rules failed
