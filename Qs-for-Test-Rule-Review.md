# Questions to consider while reviewing Baseline revisions:
1.	Does the test rule follow the ACT Test Rule format?
2.	Is the test rule aligned to WCAG 2.0 Success Criteria?
3.	Will the test rule validate successful implementation of relevant WCAG “Sufficient Techniques?”
4.	Will the test rule identify relevant WCAG “Common Failures?” 
5.	Does the test rely on a tool to facilitate inspection? If so, is the tool proprietary, open source, etc.?
6.	Is the test scalable?
7.	Can the test be taught and reproduced?
8.	Can the test rule be validated against a test subject?
